    "\n",
    "- Static models are easier to build and test.\n",
    "- Dynamic models adapt to changing data. The world is a highly changeable place. Sales predictions built from last year's data are unlikely to successfully predict next year's results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data set truly isn't changing over time, choose static training because it is cheaper to create and maintain than dynamic training. However, many information sources really do change over time, even those with features that you think are as constant as, say, sea level. The moral: even with static training, you must still monitor your input data for change.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a model trained to predict the probability that users will buy flowers. Because of time pressure, the model is trained only once using a dataset of flower buying behavior during July and August. The model is then shipped off to serve predictions in production, but is never updated. The model works fine for several months, but then makes terrible predictions around [Valentine's Day](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day) because user behavior during that holiday period changes dramatically."
