    "An **embedding** is a relatively low-dimensional space into which you can translate high-dimensional vectors. Embeddings make it easier to do machine learning on large inputs like sparse vectors representing words. Ideally, an embedding captures some of the semantics of the input by placing semantically similar inputs close together in the embedding space. An embedding can be learned and reused across models."

    "## Embeddings: Motivation From Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaborative filtering** is the task of making predictions about the interests of a user based on interests of many other users. As an example, let's look at the task of movie recommendation. Suppose we have 1,000,000 users, and a list of the movies each user has watched (from a catalog of 500,000 movies). Our goal is to recommend movies to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem some method is needed to determine which movies are similar to each other. We can achieve this goal by embedding the movies into a low-dimensional space created such that similar movies are nearby.\n",
    "\n",

    "| The Dark Knight Rises | PG-13 | Batman endeavors to save Gotham City from nuclear annihilation in this sequel to The Dark Knight, set in the DC Comics universe. |\n",
    "| Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone | PG | \tA orphaned boy discovers he is a wizard and enrolls in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he wages his first battle against the evil Lord Voldemort. |\n",

These, of course, are just two of many characteristics of movies that might be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, what we've done is mapped these movies into an **embedding space**, where each word is described by a two-dimensional set of coordinates. For example, in this space, \"Shrek\" maps to (-1.0, 0.95) and \"Bleu\" maps to (0.65, -0.2). In general, when learning a d-dimensional embedding, each movie is represented by d real-valued numbers, each one giving the coordinate in one dimension.\n",

    "In this example, we have given a name to each dimension. When learning embeddings, the individual dimensions are not learned with names. Sometimes, we can look at the embeddings and assign semantic meanings to the dimensions, and other times we cannot. Often, each such dimension is called a **latent dimension**, as it represents a feature that is not explicit in the data but rather inferred from it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Categorical data is most efficiently represented via **sparse tensors**, which are tensors with very few non-zero elements. For example, if we're building a movie recommendation model, we can assign a unique ID to each possible movie, and then represent each user by a sparse tensor of the movies they have watched, as shown in Figure 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/18-3.png)\n",

    "Each row of the matrix in Figure 3 is an example capturing a user's movie-viewing history, and is represented as a sparse tensor because each user only watches a small fraction of all possible movies. The last row corresponds to the sparse tensor [1, 3, 999999], using the vocabulary indices shown above the movie icons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise one can represent words, sentences, and documents as sparse vectors where each word in the vocabulary plays a role similar to the movies in our recommendation example.\n",
    "\n",

But how do you represent a word as a vector of numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way is to define a giant input layer with a node for every word in your vocabulary, or at least a node for every word that appears in your data. If 500,000 unique words appear in your data, you could represent a word with a length 500,000 vector and assign each word to a slot in the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you assign \"horse\" to index 1247, then to feed \"horse\" into your network you might copy a 1 into the 1247th input node and 0s into all the rest. This sort of representation is called a **one-hot encoding**, because only one index has a non-zero value.\n",
    "\n",
    "More typically your vector might contain counts of the words in a larger chunk of text. This is known as a \"bag of words\" representation. In a bag-of-words vector, several of the 500,000 nodes would have non-zero value.\n",
    "\n",
    "But however you determine the non-zero values, one-node-per-word gives you very sparse input vectorsâ€”very large vectors with relatively few non-zero values. Sparse representations have a couple of problems that can make it hard for a model to learn effectively."

Both \"dog\" and \"cat\" frequently appear close to the word \"vet\", and this fact reflects their semantic similarity.

The input layer takes a sparse representation of a target word together with one or more context words. This input connects to a single, smaller hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one version of the algorithm, the system makes a negative example by substituting a random noise word for the target word. Given the positive example \"the plane flies\", the system might swap in \"jogging\" to create the contrasting negative example \"the jogging flies\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The other version of the algorithm creates negative examples by pairing the true target word with randomly chosen context words.

This embedding layer can be combined with any other features and hidden layers. As in any DNN, the final layer will be the loss that is being optimized. For example, let's say we're performing collaborative filtering, where the goal is to predict a user's interests from the interests of other users. We can model this as a supervised learning problem by randomly setting aside (or holding out) a small number of the movies that the user has watched as the positive labels, and then optimize a softmax loss.\n",
